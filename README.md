## Interactive Learning Hub

Welcome — this repository collects short, practical "learning sheets" with copy-ready commands, quick explanations, tips and small exercises you can run in the VS Code integrated terminal.

### Current sheets
- ✅ Docker — complete: see [`docker_learning.md`](docker_learning.md) ([open file](docker_learning.md))
- ⌛ Git — coming soon
- ⌛ Linux CLI — coming soon
- ⌛ Python essentials — coming soon
- ⌛ Containers & Orchestration (Kubernetes) — coming soon
- ⌛ CI/CD basics — coming soon
- ⌛ Terraform / IaC — coming soon
- ⌛ Networking & HTTP — coming soon
- ⌛ Databases & SQL — coming soon
- ⌛ Monitoring & Troubleshooting — coming soon

Each sheet will follow the same compact template:
- Quick start checks
- Install & prepare
- Core commands (copy-ready)
- Common troubleshooting
- Small interactive exercises

### How to use
1. Open a sheet in VS Code (example: [`docker_learning.md`](docker_learning.md)).  
2. Run commands in the integrated terminal.  
3. Try the interactive exercises at the bottom of each sheet.

### Want to contribute?
Contributions and feedback are welcome.
- Add a new file named `<topic>_learning.md` following the existing Docker sheet style.
- Open a PR or create an issue with suggestions.
- Reviewers: include short examples and 2–3 exercises.

### Notes
- Only Docker is completed right now — progress will be added one sheet at a time.
- Repository files: [.gitignore](.gitignore), [docker_learning.md](docker_learning.md), [README.md](README.md).
